# Mapping_Earthquakes

This weeks challenge asked that we add features to the maps that we had already worked on in the module. We added information from two JSON's one about tetonic plates and the other about Major Earthquakes. It was added to a key at the top right of the map and the user is able to toggle back and forth to check out the different data.

The third deliverable asks to third map style, I chose the ourddors one.  Not a good choice as it is not easily noticeable when the user chooses the style in map.  The user will need to zoom in to see a noticeable change.  I chose this style because the user can see if there are any visible changes in nature where these earthquakes occur or on the borders of the tetaonic plates. For example if there are geizers or volcanos that would cause movement in the earth. 

There is a lot of information here that can be reviewed.
